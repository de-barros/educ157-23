## Course objectives

In this course, you will learn how to evaluate the effects of educational programs. You will develop three broad skill sets:

1. Applying theory to develop and assess causal statements.
2. Using modern tools for measuring causal effects.
3. Being able to judge, use, and learn with evaluations in practice.

At the end of the course, you will have developed a plan to evaluate an education program of your choice.

Specifically, at the end of the course, you should be able to do the following.

- Describe how a program expects to achieve its outcomes (its "Theory of Change").
- Develop a measurement plan along with that Theory of Change.
- Explain what is needed to make causal statements.
- Identify ethical issues and limits of evaluations.
- Understand the main analytical tools used to measure causal effects.
- Analyze data using these tools.
- Assess the quality of program evaluations and aggregate their findings.
- Know what makes evaluations valuable for education practitioners.
- Become curious and confident in consuming and producing evaluations.

## Expectations

In this course, you will be expected to

- participate in class, 
- do all readings, and discuss them outside of class,
- write four data-analytic memos,
- take one in-class exam, and
- complete four milestones, which lead up to one final evaluation plan.

## Connections to other classes

[EDUC 10](https://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=EDUC%2010) (Educational Research Design) and [EDUC 15](https://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=EDUC%2015) (Statistics for Education Research) are prerequisites for this class. That said, we will also dedicate a class to brush up on everyone's foundational statistics skills. The course does not assume any prior knowledge of statistical software. 

While we will learn about a mix of quantitative and qualitative approaches, the class emphasizes quantitative methods more strongly. In contrast, [EDUC 156](https://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=EDUC%20156) (Introduction to Field Methods in Education) provides a greater focus on qualitative methods. 

## My promise

I *promise* you can succeed in this class.

This class is all about practical application. You will notice "How will I ever use this?" is a question I consider for every class. 

Now, you will have to tool up. You will hear about weird new concepts, use some unfamiliar maths, learn new software, and approach practical questions from a new perspective. Initially, some of this might pose challenges. Most everything will be new to you. But, it's perfectly normal not to grasp concepts immediately and make mistakes during your initial encounters. This is how you acquire new skills and build a strong toolkit. 

Many parallels come to mind. Learning to ride a bike. Learning a new language. Learning how to use a hammer (and when to pick a different tool). Building muscle through training. All of these demand time, grit, and—oftentimes—productive failure. All of them are easier with friends, through apprenticeship, and by working with a coach. Similarly, if you find yourself struggling with some of the course content, that's a *good* sign. When you do, take a breather, talk to classmates, ask questions, or contact me for assistance. 

## Course structure

This syllabus reflects a plan for the quarter. Deviations may become necessary as the quarter progresses.

We meet weekly from 4:30–7:00 PM on Mondays in 330 Aderhold. ***However***, despite policies and rhetoric to the contrary, we're still in the middle of a severe global pandemic, and the BA.5 variant of COVID-19 is raging.

Accordingly, this semester we're going to have a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), which will let us maximize flexibility during this pandemic. 

We will **not** have lectures during our regularly scheduled class time. Instead, you will do the readings and watch recorded lecture videos prior to each in-person class session. You can do the readings and watch the videos on your own schedule at whatever time works best for you. Many of you work full time and you have childcare and parental care responsibilities, leaving you with only evenings for coursework. I've designed this asynchronous system with *you specifically* in mind. I also can only really do teaching work at night when my kids are in bed—I recorded all these videos between like 10 PM and 2 AM. We're all in similar pandemic boats.

We will do several things during our Monday in-person classes:

- **Extensive Q&A**: As you do the readings and watch the videos prior to class, you will inevitably have questions. In [your weekly check-in assignment](/assignment/weekly-check-in.qmd), you'll submit (at least) 3 of those questions to me prior to class. We'll spend a good chunk of each class answering, clarifying, debating, and discussing your questions.
- **Activities**: In some weeks, we'll do some in-class activities to help solidify concepts about logic models, DAGs, and other evaluation and causal inference principles.
- **R labs**: We'll spend a substantial time during each class learning and working with R together. You'll need to bring a computer.


## Course materials

Most of the readings in this class are free.

### Books

There are two official textbooks for the class. Both are available digitally and both are free.

- Paul J. Gertler et al., *Impact Evaluation in Practice*, 2nd ed. (Inter-American Development Bank; World Bank, 2016), <https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25030>. ([**Free!**](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25030))
- Nick Huntington-Klein, *The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality* (CRC Press, 2021), <https://theeffectbook.net/>. ([**Free as a HTML version!**](https://theeffectbook.net/) The print version is coming soon and is pre-orderable at Amazon.)

Both of these books are written at a more general, easy-to-understand level with relatively minimal math. *You do not need to understand all the equations and notation.* If your eyes start to gloss over the Greek letters and subscripts, it's okay. Try to learn them, but don't stress out about it too much.

In previous versions of this class I used two different books instead of *The Effect*, and they're still fantastic and I'd recommend checking them out. *The Mixtape* is a phenomenal, more detailed, more economics-focused, and mathier approach to these causal inference methods (and it's free!), while *'Metrics Matter* is a fairly canonical (and accessible!) book in the world of econometrics. I refer to these books a few times in the video lectures—don't worry, you'll get pretty much the same content in *The Effect*.

- Scott Cunningham, *Causal Inference: The Mixtape* (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021), <https://mixtape.scunning.com/>. ([**Also free(!)**](https://mixtape.scunning.com/), but there's also a print version for <span>$35</span> that you might want to get for reference after the class is over)
- Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke, Mastering ’Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2015). (**<span>$25</span> used or <span>$30</span> new at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Metrics-Path-Cause-Effect/dp/0691152845/)**)


### Articles, book chapters, and other materials

There will also occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the reading page for that week.

### R and RStudio

You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). You will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.

R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free [RStudio.cloud](http://rstudio.cloud/) service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won't have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.

RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets or more complicated analysis. Over the course of the semester, you'll probably want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud. This isn't necessary, but it's helpful.

You can [find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.](/resource/install/)

### Online help

Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you've been doing this stuff for years!).

Fortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).

If you use Twitter, post R-related questions and content with [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats). The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.

Searching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for "r scatterplot", but if it does struggle, try searching for "rstats" instead (e.g. "rstats scatterplot").

Additionally, we have a class chatroom at [Slack](https://gsuevalf2021.slack.com) where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. **I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly.** (It's one of the rare Slack workspaces where I actually have notifications enabled!) Ask questions about the readings, assignments, and project. You'll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you'll likely be able to answer other peoples' questions too.

## Assignments and grades

You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the [assignments page](/assignment/).

```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE}
assignments <- tribble(
  ~Points,   ~Assignment,
  14 * 10,   "Weekly check-ins (14 × 10)",
  9 * 30,    "Problem sets (9 × 30)",
  4 * 30,    "Evaluation assignments (4 × 30)",
  100,       "Exam 1",
  100,       "Exam 2",
  200,       "Final project"
) %>%
  mutate(Percent = Points / sum(Points),
         Percent = scales::percent(Percent))

grading <- tribble(
  ~Grade, ~Range, ~Grade1, ~Range1,
  "A",  "93–100%", "C",  "73–76%",
  "A−", "90–92%", "C−", "70–72%",
  "B+", "87–89%", "D+", "67–69%",
  "B",  "83–86%", "D",  "63–66%",
  "B−", "80–82%", "D−", "60–62%",
  "C+", "77–79%", "F",  "< 60%"
)
```

<div class="centered-table">

```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
assignments_total <- tibble(Assignment = "Total",
                            Points = sum(assignments$Points),
                            Percent = NA)

bind_rows(assignments, assignments_total) %>%
  select(Assignment, Points, Percent) %>%
  pandoc.table(justify = "lcc", missing = "—")
```
</div>

<div class="centered-table">

```{r show-grades-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
grading %>%
  pandoc.table(justify = "lclc",
               col.names = c("Grade", "Range", "Grade", "Range"))
```

<div>


You will lose 1 point per day for each day an assignment is late. This is designed to not be a huge penalty (3 days late = 27/30 points on a problem set that gets a ✓), but instead is a commitment device to help you stay on schedule.

## Course policies

**Be nice. Be honest. Don't cheat.**

We will also follow UCI's [Code of Conduct](https://www.compliance.uci.edu/ethical-values.php).

### Attendance and participation

Attendance and participation are important to your success in this course. You are expected to come to *all classes* prepared—having read the material—and ready to discuss the content. 

Missing a class has the potential to put you significantly behind. Still, life happens and, therefore, you may miss one class without contacting me (except for the midterm exam).

If you test positive for COVID-19, hunker down and focus on getting better! Please do not come to class. If you have an absence due to such an unavoidable health or emergency situation, you should message me before this class starts. Similarly, if you have to miss a class due to religious reasons, please remember to message me before the affected class starts.

You are expected to arrive before the start of each class to allow us to begin on time. Unexcused absences and late arrivals will be considered in your course participation score.  

If you have to miss the midterm exam, you will need to take a similar make-up exam during UCI's final exam period (I would assign a date and time). If at all possible, try to avoid this. There at least three reasons. First, I deliberately scheduled the class' only exam during a period in which you do not have to worry about other exams. Second, the make-up exam may also include the additional content we will have covered after the midterm exam. Third, the midterm exam is meant to prepare you for your final project---you would miss an important opportunity to check your knowledge before finalizing your evaluation plan.   

### Staying focused during class

Evidence from multiple randomized experiments indicates that students who take notes on their laptops or tablets learn less than those who take notes using pen/pencil and paper. They are also more likely to adversely affect their peers’ learning and grades (see Prof. Susan M. Dynarski’s [summary of the evidence](http://brook.gs/2vS6I3e)). Therefore, using a laptop or tablet is prohibited during class. 

There are only three exceptions: 

1. I may prompt you to take out your laptop (e.g., to complete a survey).
2. You may use a tablet that lays flat on your table, with a stylus pen (i.e., without typing on a keyboard).
3. You have an [accommodation plan](https://dsc.uci.edu/accommodations/) requiring a tablet or laptop.

Similarly, cell phone use is prohibited during class (unless I ask you to take out your phone). Please stow your phone away. 

Finally, no eating is allowed during class. If you eat during class, you are likely to disrupt the classroom dynamic. You may bring a water bottle or coffee/tea in a covered container.

Let's stay focused!

### Late assignments

You should budget enough time to submit all course assignments well ahead of each deadline. Late assignments will not be accepted, regardless of how late they are. No extensions will be granted due to religious holidays, sickness, or any other reasons. Instead, I will disregard your assignment with the lowest score. I suggest using this option cautiously, just in case something happens, you foresee needing time to observe a religious holiday, or any other issue that may keep you from submitting your assignment on time.    

### Academic honesty

Violation of the [UCI Academic Senate Policy on Academic Integrity](https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php) will result in an F in the course and possible disciplinary action.[^cheat] Violating the Academic Integrity Policy is unacceptable, devaluing the teaching and learning experience for the entire community. All violations will be formally reported.

[^cheat]: So seriously, just don't cheat or plagiarize! If you have not already, review [this](https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php) website.  

### Drop policy

Following [UCI's policy](https://www.reg.uci.edu/enrollment/adc/adcpolicy.html), no drops are allowed after the second week of instruction.


## Doing well

### A personal note

If you tell me you're having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you'll extend me the same grace.

You *never* owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are *always* welcome to talk to me about things that you're going through, though. If I can't help you, I usually know somebody who can.

If you need extra help, or if you feel like you're behind or not understanding everything, **do not suffer in silence!** Talk to me! I will work with you. 

### Student hours

Please watch this video:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/270014784" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 1rem;"></iframe>

Student hours are set times dedicated to all of you (most professors call these "office hours"; I don't).[^studenthours] This means that I will be waiting to come by to talk to me---either remotely or in-person---with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.

[^studenthours]: There's fairly widespread misunderstanding about what office hours actually are! [Many students often think that they are the times I *shouldn't* be disturbed](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Can-This-Man-Change-How-Elite/245714/), which is the exact opposite of what they're for!

It is easiest to meet with me online. [Make an appointment with me here](https://calendly.com/de-barros/)—the confirmation e-mail will contain a link for a Zoom meeting (the default). If you prefer an in-person meeting, (1) schedule a Zoom meeting first, then (2) contact me via e-mail or Slack, at least one day before our meeting.

### On-campus resources

Life at UCI can be complicated and challenging. Fortunately, UCI offers a wealth of resources to support you. 

Please take the time to seriously consider the following (confidential) resources available to you. 

-	[Emergency food and toiletries](https://basicneeds.uci.edu/fresh-pantry/)
-	[More broadly, services at the UCI Basic Needs Center](https://basicneeds.uci.edu/all-services/)
-	[Services at the UCI Counseling Center](https://counseling.uci.edu)
-	[Support to become a better writer](http://www.writingcenter.uci.edu)
- [Guides at UCI Libraries](https://guides.lib.uci.edu/), including on [academic writing](https://guides.lib.uci.edu/scientificwriting) and how to [cite your sources](https://guides.lib.uci.edu/citations)
- [Tutoring and mentoring options](https://larc.uci.edu/all-services/)
-	[Resources at UCI's Cross-Cultural Center](https://ccc.uci.edu)
-	[Resources for DACA students](http://dreamers.uci.edu)
-	[Resources for first-generation college students](http://firstgen.due.uci.edu)
-	[Resources for those caring for (or expecting) little anteaters](http://transferhub.uci.edu/resources/student-parent-resources/)

One of the (very few) things I regret from college is that I did not ask for enough help. I'm sure at least one of the above can help you do better---do reach out.

### Safety

**I will listen to and believe you if someone is threatening you.**

If you are in immediate danger, call 911. UCI police provides a 24-hour safety escort (949-824-5223) and a 24-hour *non*-emergency line (also at 949-824-5223). Safe this number.

Please double-check and make sure you are signed up to [zotAlert](https://www.oit.uci.edu/services/communication-collaboration/zotalert/).

If you are experiencing sexual assault or misconduct, domestic or relationship violence, stalking, or retaliation, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources. The University of California, Irvine is committed to creating and maintaining an environment in which all persons who live, work, and learn in our campus community can be free of sexual assault, sexual misconduct, relationship violence, stalking, and retaliation. Every member of the University community should be aware that sexual violence is prohibited by law as well as our University policy and will not be tolerated. 

At any time---even if you are in doubt, or would like to know more about what you can do to *prevent* cases---do not hesitate to reach out to [UCI Care](https://care.uci.edu/) and the [Sexual Harassment/Title IX Officer (SHO)](https://www.oeod.uci.edu/sho/index.php).   

### Accommodations and accessibility

If you wish to request academic accommodations you may do so through the [Disability Services Center (DSC)](https://dsc.uci.edu/accommodations/). To obtain services, please [register with DSC](https://dsc.uci.edu/register/) and complete the [DSC Intake Form](https://portal.dsc.uci.edu/intake/). You should then make an appointment with me during the first week of class to discuss any accommodations that need to be made.

I will do everything possible to make sure our course materials are accessible. *Please* let me know if you know of ways to improve on this further. Even a short message on, say, the colors I use on a slide can help a lot.  

## Course philosophy

Classical statistics classes spend substantial time covering probability theory, null hypothesis testing, and other statistical tests first developed hundreds of years ago. Some classes don't use software or actual real data and instead live in the world of mathematical proofs. They can be math-heavy and full of often unintuitive concepts and equations.

In this class, we will take the opposite approach. We *begin* with data and learn how to tidy, wrangle, manipulate, and visualize it with code. Later in the semester we'll turn to the powerful toolbox of causal inference approaches, but continue to keep the focus on data as we do so.

In other words, there's way less of this:

$$
f(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac12 x^2}
$$

And way more of this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
summary_monthly_temp <- weather %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(temp),
            std_dev = sd(temp))
```

Over the last decade there has been a revolution in statistical and scientific computing. Open source languages like R and Python have overtaken older (and expensive!) corporate software packages like SAS and SPSS, and there are now thousands of books and blog posts and other online resources with excellent tutorials about how to analyze pretty much any kind of data.

This class will expose you to [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you'll learn in this class, you'll know enough to be able to find how to analyze any sort of data-based question in the future.
