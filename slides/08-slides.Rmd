(happier people more likely to get married, so without randomly assigning marriage how would you study the impact of marriage on happiness?). They use a simple approach - since happiness varies over time set marriage equal to time zero and build a pre-post design around it. You essentially leverage the within-group variance and iron out across-age differences because of the varying ages of marriage. The whole insight it to change the time-line from calendar years to program years.

.box-6[People might drop out because of the treatment,<br>or because they got/didn't get into the control group]

???

You don't have data on them. NA values. Even if people don't comply (like move to a private school), you can still get data on them, so that's okay. People might drop out randomly, and that would be fine. But if attrition is correlated with the treatment, then it's bad. People might drop because of the treatment, or because they didn't get the control group. Impossible to sign the bias—could be tons of different reasons.

# Addressing attrition

--

.box-inv-6.less-medium[Get people on board]

.box-6.sp-after[Get participants invested in the experiment]

--

.box-inv-6.less-medium[Collect as much baseline information as possible]

.box-6[Check for randomization of attrition]

???

- Recruit as effectively as possible (so you don't get volunteers that routinely sign up for randomized experiments). Use money for recruitment

- Get people on board. Treatment might be less/more enjoyable than the control group, so people will feel lucky or unlucky to be in the treatment group - explain why the experiment itself is important. Make them invested in getting the experiment to work. Science! Why you want the right answer beyond whether or not the treatment works

- Collect as much baseline information as possible before assigning to treatment and control groups - doesn't help reduce attrition like getting people on board, but it lets us see if attrition is random with respect to preexisting characteristics - checks for randomization failures. Don't rerandomize. Randomize and then suck it up.

ITT is probably the most policy-related measure - if there's a low compliance rate but a good ITT effect, you can try to make the program nicer, better

MTO varied income, not race, since it's illegal to tell people they can only move to a white neighborhood. So they used income instead of race. Keys under the light issue, since the original issue was about race

Scalability issue with STAR. It wasn't hard to hire 40 more teachers in TN. California couldn't find enough teachers, so they emergency certified "a bunch of morons," which messed up the program effect
