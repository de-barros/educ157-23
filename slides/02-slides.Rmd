Draw impact theory: access to computers → 21st century skills, access to global marketplace, reduction of poverty, growth of local businesses

Everything fell apart though. It wasn’t ready—it had unrealistic expectations and was too utopian. It also didn’t take local conditions into account

Improved access to water → better health, better education, reduction in poverty

> The Guardian calculated in 2009 that children would have to "play" for 27 hours every day to meet PlayPumps' stated targets of providing 2,500 people per pump with their daily water needs. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout_PlayPump)

Have kids play to get water out. Led to overuse – main problem in many areas isn’t access to water, but scarcity of water – only works in locations with lots of good water that’s not too deep and where infrastructure is lacking

Is children playing is an appropriate source of energy for water? The line between work and play isn’t as clear-cut as one would think. – can lead to exploitation
