Gram Panchayat (GP) Level Mathematics Contests are organised by the community for government school children in all GKA (Ganitha Kalika Andolana) districts of Karnataka. It’s a strategy to empower the community to take up quality to take up quality issues in the public school system within the framework of participatory democracy. Akshara Foundation acts as a facilitator to conduct these contests. The child’s numeracy levels data gathered through this contest is the most accurate and census level data available as the contests are conducted in the community with the presence of all stakeholders (Gram Panchayat members, parents, SDMC members, donors and the village community) in a transparent way

Intestinal helminths—including hookworm, roundworm, whipworm, and schistosomiasis—infect more than one-quarter of the world’s population. Researchers evaluated a mass school-based deworming program in Western Kenya.

???

We set out to discover whether scholarships could help third- and fourth-grade students in rural, impoverished areas of Cambodia attend and stay in primary school. More than that, we wanted to know which type of scholarship worked better — a merit scholarship, awarded based on academic achievement, or poverty scholarships, awarded according to highest financial need. Our research followed-up on these children 9 later, when they had reached young adulthood.

# Formative teacher evaluations in Chile

???

In Chile, every four years, all public-school teachers participate in the country's formative teacher evaluation system. The system has four components: Teachers submit a portfolio (which includes a video-recording of a class) and a self-evaluation. They are also evaluated by a peer and through their superiors (e.g., their principal). The system is mainly formative, and seeks to improve the quality of teaching in public schools.

# Class-size reductions in Tennessee

???

Aware of both the preliminary results of a CSR program in Indiana called Project Prime Time and the potential large scale costs of additional classrooms and teachers, in 1985, under then Governor Lamar Alexander, Tennessee began a three-phase project to determine the effects of reduced class sizes on short and long term pupil performance in the earliest grades.

The first phase, termed Project STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio), randomly assigned teachers and students to three groups, “small” (13 to 17), “regular” (22 to 25) classes with a paid aide, and “regular” (22 to 25) classes with no aide. In total some 6,500 students in about 330 classrooms at approximately 80 schools participated.

How does a large unconditional increase in salary affect the performance of incumbent employees in the public sector? A policy change in Indonesia led to a permanent doubling of teacher base salaries.

Polio shots administered blindly with placebo - kids didn't know, doctor didn't know (double blind) - effect found

Why not just use those who didn't get a shot as the control group? Why placebo? Kids who opted out were poor (which actually had a lower incidence rate), so you can't compare them with the rich (which had higher incidence rate)

All drugs get the safety and efficacy requirement and double blind RCTs after that

Words of wisdom from @allison_horst: You don't need to be a mechanic to drive a car safely, and you don't need to be a computer scientist or developer to use R safely. #rstats #tidytuesday

https://twitter.com/ameliaritger/status/1214682596182904832?s=12

There’s three levels of skill: driver, mechanic, engineer. You’re here to get your drivers license. But being able to change a tire can be helpful. Don’t worry not every one has to be an engineer. (I talk about R in social sciences)
