## Readings

Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete ***before*** our in-person meetings. Reading reactions are due at 11:55 PM on the day before class (via Slack). 

## Slides

I will also post slides on the day of class. You may bring a printed copy. I may edit these slides and post a final version shortly after class. Please make sure to use this final version as you prepare for your assignments and the exam.
