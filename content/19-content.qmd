This class includes a live interview with one of the organizations with which I am currently conducting a program evaluation. Instead of reading reactions, I will ask you to submit questions for our guest. 

## Readings

I will point you to materials describing the organization. I will also provide you with background information on my evaluation.

## Optional material

The following reading is optional. 

- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Jake Bowers and Rebecca Wolfe. ["10 Conversations that Implementers and Evaluators Need to Have,"](https://egap.org/resource/10-implementer-evaluator-conversations/) *egap*, no date.


## Slides

On the day of class, you will find my slides on Canvas.
