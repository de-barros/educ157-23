This class includes a live interview with one of the organizations with which I am currently conducting a program evaluation. Instead of reading reactions, I will ask you to submit questions to our guest. 

## Readings

I will point you to materials describing the organization. I will also provide you with background information on my evaluation.

## Slides

On the day of class, you will find my slides on Canvas.
